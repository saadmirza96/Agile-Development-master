4. 
It's the end of Day 2 and after spending a day in the field doing interviews, the team feels uncertain about what they're doing. What's your best move?

vvvv	Schedule a mini retrospective (probably via Skype or Google Hangout) with a specific agenda, including a round robin on what's been hard, what's been easy and what they'd like to keep, add, and change process wise.

It's fine! Really! Just keep at it.

Provide a template for a shared medium (Google Doc's or email) that asks them to report on two simple things: how many people they've interviewed and their top five learnings.

Review their transcripts on Google Doc's and tweak the interview guide to make sure the team is getting the right info.
